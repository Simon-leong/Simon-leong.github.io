# 😊 About Me

Greetings! I am Qifan Liang (Simon Leong), a current undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Wuhan University, and also a lab member of the [National Multimedia Software Engineering Technology Research Center at Wuhan University](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/). Fortunately, I have conducted computer vision research under Prof. [Jens Rittscher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ED4V7hEAAAAJ) at Oxford University, Prof. [Zhen Han](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?a=show&catid=69&id=135) and Prof. [Kaimin Sun](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/sunkaimin/en/index/259374/list/index.htm) at Wuhan University. Lastly, welcome to follow my [github account](https://github.com/Simon-leong)!


# 🔬 Research Interest
"Computer vision will open our eyes to a new world of possibilities, where machines not only see but understand the world as we do." - Inspired by Fei-Fei Li

My research interests : 
- **Fundamentals and applications** of deep learning algorithms, and design of training strategies for **few-shot scenarios**. 
- Exploring the recovery of **visually distorted elements** (smoke, haze, shadow) in dynamic environments, especially in the medical field. 
- **Human-centered visual perception** and **2D/3D scene understanding**.

## 🏀 Sports

- I have a deep passion for badminton, showcased through years of competing in local tournaments and organizing community matches to share the sport's excitement. 
- Swimming also holds a special place in my heart. From early morning training sessions to competing in relay races and open-water events, I’ve consistently pushed my limits.
